# binary-clock
A small binary clock program to use with a Raspberry Pi (only tested with the Pi 1)

You can find the GPIO map I used [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/) (the last picture and the bottom of the page).
I used the SH74HC595 shift registers and you can find the data sheet [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/IC/SN74HC595.pdf).
